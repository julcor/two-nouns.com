<div class="project-title">The Rural Libraries Project<br>2018</div>

<div class="project-desc">The Rural Libraries Project (RLP) was created to provide resources, facilities and an institutional program that promotes literacy in marginalised rural communities in Southern Africa, where illiteracy is high and a culture of reading is low. The first site and pilot project was established in Tete, Mozambique, a prototype for a network of children’s libraries and community centers for regions throughout southern African that lack adequate educational resources and facilities. The project envisions the library as a landscape and playground. Conceived as an interior topography of books, the undulating reading terraces and mounds provide an animated ground for reading, play and activity, and an immersive environment for the imagination. Programmatic pits, pods and platforms provide research areas, computer facilities, a play center, conference rooms and a space for outdoor assembly as a de facto community center.</div>
